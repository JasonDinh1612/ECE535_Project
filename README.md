# ECE535_Project

# Project Idea: 
We have picked Project 4: Deep-Learning-based Tracking for Mobile Systems. We think we can do this project because we both are doing a project for SDP which includes using sensors and collecting data from them as well as doing image processing. We both have some background in sensors and acquiring data. So doing this project will also be helpful to us in our SDP

# Motivation:
- A better understanding of deep learning tracking algorithms.
- An opportunity to learn more about image processing and map generation.
- Apply knowledge of Machine Learning as well as sensors to the project.
# Design Goals:
Developing deep learning tracking algorithm for two mobile systems

# Deliverables:
- Implement and understand an end-to-end learning approach for tracking â€“ TartanVO
- Benchmark TartanVO on two datasets to evaluate its performance (data & code provided)
- Analyze performance differences across datasets and reason about it

# System block:

# Hardware/Software Requirements:
Python, Laptop with CUDA-enabled GPU

# Team member responsibilities:
- Jason: Time management
- Aakash: Gathering Data
# Project timeline:
Stay on track and finish the project before deadline.
